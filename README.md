## Welcome to the Change Calculator

#Usage

Very simple to use. Type in how much money is due into the `Amount Due` box, how much is paid into the `Amount Paid` box, and press calculate. It will output how much change is due in the following format (we'll use $3.50 in change as an example):

    Dollars: 3
    Quarters: 2
    Dimes: 0
    Nickels: 0
    Pennies: 0
